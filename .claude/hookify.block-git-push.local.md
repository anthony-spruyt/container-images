**BLOCKED: git push is not allowed**

This repository requires manual pushes (see CLAUDE.md Hard Rules).

**Why?**

- SSH passkey requires interactive authentication
- User must verify changes before pushing to remote
- Prevents accidental pushes to protected branches

**What to do instead:**

1. Inform the user that changes are ready to push
2. Let the user run `git push` manually
3. After push, run cluster-validator if changes affect `cluster/`
