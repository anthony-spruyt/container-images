**BLOCKED: Use the Read tool instead of cat**

You attempted to read a file with `cat`. Use Claude's Read tool instead.

**Why?**

- Read tool is optimized for Claude's context
- Supports offset/limit for large files
- Better file handling and error messages

**What to do:**
Use the Read tool with the file path.
